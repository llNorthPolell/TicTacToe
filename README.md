# TicTacToe
Made this entirely out of notepad, and w3schools Tryit Editor for testing, because I can.



Description
-----------

I had spare time at work since we had to wait for some trucks to arrive before we can leave. Made this within 2 hours out of 
notepad since I can't install anything on a company computer. 

Added stylesheets and styling scripts to make things look fancy. 


Tools Used
----------

- Notepad - To publish code
- W3Schools Tryit Editor - for coding and testing


Known Bugs
----------
- clicking the "Player X wins!" or "~EPIC DRAW~" adds a new game directly to the right of the current one
- with the above bug, any unfilled buttons can still be filled with X's and O's, but this is only a visual bug which could be eliminated by eliminating the above bug
