# TicTacToe
Made this entirely out of notepad, and w3schools Tryit Editor for testing, because I can.



Description
-----------

I had spare time at work since we had to wait for some trucks to arrive before we can leave. Made this within 2 hours out of 
notepad since I can't install anything on a company computer. 

Added stylesheets and styling scripts to make things look fancy.
